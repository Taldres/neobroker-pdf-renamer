# Neobroker PDF Renamer

This tool helps you rename your Neobroker PDF files and converts the ugly names like `2023-01-05 08ï€º40 Kauf FTSE All-World High Dividend Yield USD (Dist) 1.pdf` (Example: Trade Republic) into short and beautiful ones like `IE00B8GKDB10_20230105-1.pdf`. 

Optionally you can group them into subfolders by type (crypto and securities) and/or ISIN/abbreviation:
